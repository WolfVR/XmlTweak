# XmlTweak
Tool to sort and format xml based files for easier diff compares.

## Why Tweak?
I've recently been working on projects that use multiple XML based files to configure the application.  When trying to run diffs on these files to see changes and additions, I've found it difficult to compare versions depending on who last edited the file and what tool they were using.

I've tried XML sorting tools, which have helped greatly, but I would still run into issues were the formatting of the document was different, or empty tags were inserted, so I needed a tool that would sort and address formatting inconsistencies.

XMlTweak is my attempt at a solution to these issues.
